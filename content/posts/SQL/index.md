## General

* SQL works off a relational set of rules. This nmeans that the data is often organized in multiple tables that all reference/interact with each other.
  * One example of this is a SQL database with customer information. Rather than having a single table that contains this data, the data can be stored across multiple tables and contain a key that links the information. This is useful because it allos you to have a a more varired data set, while still remaining searchable.

## Syntax

### SQL Statement

Is an expression that tells the database what you want it to do.

* **SELECT -** 
* **INSERT -** 
* **UPDATE -** 
* **DELETE -**
